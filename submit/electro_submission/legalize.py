"""Complete legalization for the analytical placer.

Turns a near-legal analytical placement into one with EXACTLY zero overlap while
  * keeping preplaced blocks at their exact (x, y, w, h)  -- pinned, never moved;
  * keeping every block's SHAPE unchanged (so soft-block area stays exact and
    fixed-block dims stay locked -- legalization only moves blocks);
  * perturbing positions as little as possible (preserves wirelength).

Algorithm
=========
1. Separation assignment.  For every block pair pick ONE axis to separate it in:
   the axis where it currently overlaps least (equivalently, is most separated).
   If, after legalization, every pair is separated in its assigned axis, then no
   pair overlaps -- this is what makes the two 1-D problems below sufficient.

2. Per-axis constraint-graph compaction (longest-path / Liao-Wong relaxation).
   The assignment induces a DAG of "i is left/below j" difference constraints
   (x_j >= x_i + w_i).  Processing blocks in coordinate order and pushing each
   one just past its already-placed predecessors is a single-pass longest-path
   solve.  It is order-preserving and minimum-perturbation (a block only moves
   if a predecessor forces it).  Preplaced blocks are fixed anchors.
   The x-pass and y-pass are INDEPENDENT because each pair lives in one axis only.

3. Guaranteed-zero-overlap backstop.  The only way step 2 can leave an overlap is
   a movable block wedged against a fixed anchor (a pin can't be pushed).  Those
   are removed by bounded pairwise push-apart, and -- as a last resort that can
   never fail -- by evicting the movable block to empty space above the layout.

4. Assertion.  We re-scan and confirm exactly zero overlap before returning.

Everything is O(n^2) per scan, trivial for FloorSet's n <= 120.
